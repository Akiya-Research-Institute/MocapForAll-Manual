# Capture from recorded video

From v1.12, you can capture motion using recorded videos.

## How to use

- Select `Recorded video` from the `â–¼` next to `Add camera` at the top of the MocapForAll window.   
- Press the `...` button and select the video file.  
- After that, the usage is basically the same as a normal webcam.

## Playback positions

- The video will automatically loop.
- The playback position of the video will return to the beginning of the video when you press `Start Capture`.

## Tips

- It is recommended to separate the video files for intrinsic parameter calibration, extrinsic parameter calibration, and actual motion capture.
- There is no function to analyze the videos and synchronize the movements between them, so it is necessary to edit the videos in advance so that the movements will be synchronized when they are played at the same time from the beginning. When recording videos, it is recommended to clarify the starting point with a clapperboard or the sound of clapping your hands.
